# country_list_app


It is aimed to fetch country information from the internet by using the REST Countries API resource, create a model instance from each of these countries, and display them on the screen after Searching for the country.

In the application, bloc, http, dio intl, provider, collection, and sliver_tools packages are mainly used.


One of the major challenges faced is time constraint.

A feature i would lovw to add is diversify the country information in the application. (maybe you can wrap the PageView widget with the AboutDialog widget)
